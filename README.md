# Computer Vision Application Project

## Overview

This project is a mobile application for real-time multi-modal product detection, built using React Native, Node.js, Python3, Flask, and Expo Go. The app leverages computer vision to detect and process blob/main/images and videos, providing a seamless user experience for product identification and management. This project was completed as part of our DASS course for Perceptive Analysis.
